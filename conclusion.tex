\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented A3, Automatic Asynchronous Aggregation. We clearly define the conditions for asynchronous aggregation and propose to prioritize the aggregate computations that most affect result. We also propose a technique to allow automatic asynchronization. We further design and implement a Datalog system, A3Log, to support automatic asynchronous computation of the user's program. A3Log provides both shared-memory runtime and distributed runtime. Our results show that A3Log outperforms the state-of-the-art systems for various applications. Asynchronous execution is shown to achieve up to two-orders-of-magnitude speedup over synchronous execution.
